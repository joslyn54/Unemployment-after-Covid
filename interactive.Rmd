# Interactive component


We intend to visualize the unemployment rates of each state in the U.S. from October 2019 to September 2022. The interactive visualization can be accessed here: [Interactive Visualization](https://vizhub.com/niuyizhan/17715675a3944405becc4ee6064c6e60)

We implemented a feature that allows users to select a state from the dropdown list on the top of the page so that they can explore the unemployment rate along the time. Whenever users move the month on a bar, a label of corresponding unemployment rate for this month will appear.  

We also explored the geographical distribution of unemployment rates using a map. The size of the blue dots represent the intensity of unemployment situation in that state.
