This project intends to explore unemployment conditions in the United States after the Covid-19 pandemic. Specifically, we will conduct a series of exploratory data analysis and visualization to exhibit unemployment situations from September 2021 to September 2022. We will investigate unemployment status from multiple perspectives, such as geographical distribution among the U.S., distribution among different races and ages, and the relationships between unemployment and other economic metrics like CPI, GDP, etc. Our Book URL is: https://niuyizhan.github.io/UnemploymentAfterCovid/.
