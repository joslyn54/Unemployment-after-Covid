[["index.html", "Exploring Unemployment Conditions in the United States After Covid-19 Chapter 1 Introduction", " Exploring Unemployment Conditions in the United States After Covid-19 Kaiyuan Liu (kl3447), Zhuolin Luo (zl2852), Yizhan Niu (yn2440) 2022-12-15 Chapter 1 Introduction With the Covid-19 virus fading away from our lives, we are gradually entering the post-pandemic era. It seems that our lives are getting back on track to the pre-pandemic levels. However, the impact of the pandemic on the global economy, especially on the labor market, has not completely disappeared. According to the Lead Editor of Forbes Advisor Benjamin Curry, “inflation hit a 40-year high of 9.1%” in 2022, which was seen as an aftershock of the pandemic. (cited from https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/why-is-inflation-rising-right-now/) To better understand whether our economy has recovered from this pandemic, we would like to estimate the impact of Covid-19 on the labor market by analyzing unemployment conditions two years after the pandemic. As an indicator of economic health, the unemployment rate can effectively reflect how the overall market performs. Is the economy in this country in a recessionary period or an expansionary period? Are most people in the labor market having trouble finding a new job? A well-established analysis of unemployment can help us better answer these questions. There are five aspects we will dig deep into in order to comprehend the unemployment condition in the US after the pandemic. First, we would like to know how the unemployment rate has changed over the past ten years to see whether the time-series chart shows us any patterns during and after Covid-19. Second, we would like to know how the unemployment condition of each state changes over time in the US. Third, we want to investigate the intensity of the impacts unemployment has on each race group. Fourth, we want to see the influence of the pandemic on the unemployment rate in the groups of each age interval and both genders. Finally, we will compare the unemployment rate with GDP and CPI data to understand the unemployment condition in the context of the economy on a macro scale. By putting the unemployment rate in the context of time, location, race, age, gender, and economy, we can better understand the impact of the pandemic on the economy in general two years after the outbreak of Covid-19. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic As announced in September 2022 by the World Health Organization, the end of the Covid-19 pandemic was in sight. This was a piece of great news for the United States and even the whole world. However, this global pandemic has already lasted for three years and made significant impacts on the economy, culture, and society. Most importantly, lots of people’s daily lives have been severely influenced. In addition to the effects on social life and physical activities, the Covid-19 pandemic has forced many people to lose their jobs. Based on this phenomenon, our group is interested in the unemployment situation in the U.S. after the Covid outbreak, especially the recent period from September 2021 to September 2022. How did the unemployment situation change after Covid-19 burst out? Can we find any pattern along the time? How did the economic conditions influence the unemployment rates in the U.S.? Was the state location a vital factor to consider when it came to the unemployment rate in the U.S.? Did the factors, such as race, age, etc., affect a person’s employment status? Several questions arose in our brains. We intend to get some intuitions into the answers to these questions in this project by conducting a series of exploratory data analysis and visualization. We collected our data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) website according to our interests. The BLS is the principal fact-finding agency for the Federal government in the broad fields of labor economics and statistics. All data on the website are public and can be legally used by us. 2.2 Data availability To investigate the unemployment conditions in the United States, we have decided to utilize the data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. We consider these data sources because they are the U.S. official departments that provide officially valid data. Based on such data, we will draw more convincing conclusions. More details can be accessed from the [Documentation of Unemployment Situation] (https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf) Most of our data can be downloaded directly as an Excel file. Some of them need to be downloaded as HTML files, and then we will extract the corresponding information using ‘rvest’ package in R. If we have any questions regarding data, we will attempt to contact the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis via email, Twitter or LinkedIn. The data is fairly accurate, while the data might suffer from the sampling bias from surveys. Below are five aspects we intend to explore and corresponding data sources for our project. 2.2.1 Unemployment Situation by Month Firstly, we intend to visualize the seasonally adjusted unemployed population and unemployment rates for each month in the United States from September 2021 to September 2022. The data comes from the Current Population Survey (CPS), a household survey administered by the U.S. Census Bureau on a sample of 60,000 households about the employment situation, provided by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The historical data is updated monthly and can be retrieved from the [Labor Force Statistics (CPS) Database] (https://www.bls.gov/webapps/legacy/cpsatab1.htm). This database contains employment and unemployment conditions for the total civilian population, men of 16 years old and above, women of 16 years old and above, men of 20 years old and above, women of 20 years old and above, and both sexes with 16-19 years old. Under each category, employment metrics such as employment-population ratio, unemployed population, unemployment rate, etc., are listed. In this task, we will only focus on the unemployed population and unemployment rate for the total civilian population. We will use seasonally adjusted data to eliminate the influence of predictable seasonal patterns and provide a more meaningful metric. By selecting the above conditions and clicking on the “Retrieve Data” button, we will get two tables: unemployed population and unemployment rates for the total civilian population, respectively. Each table records unemployment data, which is continuous numerical data, from January 2012 to September 2022. We will download these two tables from the website as two Excel files and import them into R studio directly. We will use the “dplyr” package in R to filter the corresponding data between September 2021 and September 2022. If we have any questions, we will attempt to contact the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics via email or social media like Twitter. 2.2.2 Unemployment Rates by State Secondly, we plan to investigate the geographical distribution of unemployment conditions in the United States from September 2021 to September 2022. Specifically, we will visualize each state’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rates, provided by the Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS) program under the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The state unemployment rate is the sum of two parts: estimates from the Current Population Survey (CPS)——the source of national unemployment rates——and real-time estimates controlled by models. These models reflect current and historical data from the CPS, the Current Employment Statistics (CES) survey, and state unemployment insurance (UI) systems. The unemployment rates are updated on a monthly basis, and the data can be accessed from [Local Area Unemployment Statistics Map] (https://data.bls.gov/lausmap/showMap.jsp;jsessionid=26EFE5EB9A9FF91E84278E09CECCDA06._t3_08v). Each page presents the state unemployment rate for a specific month. By selecting different years and months, we can access the historical unemployment data at different times. The monthly unemployment data is a two-column table. The first column records the name of each state, which is categorical data, and the second one records the unemployment rate for a specific month, which is continuous numerical data. We plan to utilize the “rvest” package in R to crawl the unemployment information in the table. We will first download the pages for each month and then process them one by one in R. If we have any questions, we will contact the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics via email or social media like Twitter. 2.2.3 Unemployment Situation by Race Thirdly, we plan to investigate the unemployment status of the civilian population by different races (i.e., White, Black or African American, and Asian) from September 2021 to September 2022. Specifically, we will focus on the seasonally adjusted unemployed population and unemployment rates for different races. The data is collected from the Current Population Survey (CPS) by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The data can be retrieved from the [Labor Force Statistics (CPS) Database] (https://www.bls.gov/webapps/legacy/cpsatab2.htm), which contains employment data for White, Black or African American, and Asian. Under each race, the employment status data, such as employed population, unemployed population, unemployment rates, etc., of the total civilian population, men with 20 years old and above, women with 20 years old and above, and both sexes with 16-19 years old is provided. Here we will only select seasonally adjusted unemployed population and unemployment rates for the total civilian population under each race. Finally, we will get six tables, which are “Unemployment Level-White”, “Unemployment Rates-White”, “Unemployment Level-Black or African American”, “Unemployment Rates-Black or African American”, “Unemployment Level-Asian”, and “Unemployment Rates-Asian”. The rows of each table are the years from 2012 to 2022, and the columns are the months from January to December. Each table records the continuous numerical data for each metric. Each table can be downloaded directly as an Excel file, and we will import those six files into R studio directly and filter data between September 2021 and September 2022. For more information, we will contact the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics via email or social media like Twitter. 2.2.4 Unemployment Situation by Age Fourthly, we want to investigate the unemployment status of the civilian population by age from September 2021 to September 2022. Specifically, we would like to visualize the seasonally adjusted unemployment population based on each age interval provided by the Division of Labor Force Statistics under the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The data was estimated through the household survey given by the Bureau of Labor Statistics based on 60,000 household data sampled by the U.S. Census Bureau. The unemployment rate data by age can be retrieved from the [Labor Force Statistics (CPS) Database] (https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t09.htm). The data specifically shows the estimated unemployment population in the U.S. at different age intervals and were further separated into two tables by gender. The table divides age intervals into six: 16 to 17 years, 18 to 19 years, 25 to 34 years, 35 to 44 years, 45 to 54 years, and 55 years and over. Within each table by gender and age, the data was separated into two parts: not seasonally adjusted data and seasonally adjusted data. Because the unemployment rate is influenced by season, seasonally adjusted data helps us better understand the influence of the economy on the labor market. We may use the web scraper package “rvest” in R as what we did in our PSet2 to import those data from September 2021 to September 2022. For the unemployment rate by age, we can contact the Division of Labor Force Statistics in the Bureau of Labor Statistics for more information via their email or phone number. The data quality is quite high, while the only issue is that the sampling errors may partly influence the sample accuracy. 2.2.5 GDP and CPI by Region We decided to investigate the regional GDP and CPI data from 2021 to 2022 across the United States from September 2021 to September 2022. We plan to visualize these geospatial data of GDP and CPI on a map to represent the percentage changes of these two indicators, which will help us better understand the unemployment situation in terms of its economic context in the post-pandemic era from 2021 to 2022. The GDP data was maintained by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), and the CPI data was maintained by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). These GDP data was collected by the Regional Product Division of BEA from the Department of Agriculture, the Census Bureau, and other federal agencies based on different indicators such as income for the services-producing industries. The CPI data was calculated by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) by sampling prices of goods from 6,000 households and 22,000 retail stores each month in 75 major regions in the U.S. The GDP data is updated on a quarterly basis and can be accessed from [Gross Domestic Product Dataset] https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gdp-state. The CPI data is on a monthly basis and can be accessed from [Geographic Information of Consumer Price Index] https://www.bls.gov/regions/subjects/consumer-price-indexes.htm. The GDP data shows the seasonally adjusted percentage change of GDP from Q1 2022 to Q2 2022 within different industries based on about 50 major cities across the U.S. Each table of the CPI dataset shows one-month and twelve-month percentage changes in the CPI of all items. Each table represents a region and has monthly data from Jan. 2018 to Sep. 2022. There are also detailed CPI index data based on different categories of goods. Both GDP and CPI data are rendered on the website in a table, and we may use the web scraper package “rvest” in R as what we did in our PSet2 to import those data. For GDP data, we can contact the Department of Commerce in the Bureau of Economic Analysis for more information via their email address. For CPI data, we can contact the Division of Consumer Prices and Price Indexes in the Bureau of Labor Statistics via their email or phone number. "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis", " Chapter 3 Data To comprehensively investigate the unemployed situation after the Covid-19 pandemic, we will visualize the unemployed population and unemployment rates from the following five different perspectives: Monthly unemployment rate trend Unemployment rates of each state Unemployment rates of different races Unemployment situation of different-aged men and women Relationships among the unemployed population, GDP, and CPI Each section corresponds to one or multiple separate dataset(s), so we will discuss the data source, data cleaning and transformation process, and missing value analysis regarding each part separately. 3.1 Sources As described above, we will focus on the above five aspects regarding unemployment, including monthly trends, geographical distribution, race, age, and sex-related differences, and relationships to macroeconomic factors. We chose these aspects because we think they can capture most characteristics of the unemployed situation after the Covid-19 pandemic in the U.S. To fully investigate it, we have decided to utilize the data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. We consider these data sources because they are the U.S. official departments that provide officially valid data. Next, we will discuss these data sources regarding each aspect in detail. 3.1.1 Monthly Unemployment Rate Firstly, we will visualize the time series data of seasonally adjusted unemployment rates for each month in the United States from January 2012 to November 2022. The data is collected and published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on a monthly basis. The unemployed information is collected from the Current Population Survey (CPS), a household survey about the employment situation administered by the U.S. Census Bureau on a sample of 60,000 U.S. households. We chose this data source because of its reliability and authority. Following the methods described in Section 2.2, we got a table summarizing the monthly unemployment rates from January 2012 to November 2022. This table includes 13 columns and 11 rows. The 13 columns encompass year and 12 months, respectively, while the 11 rows contain unemployment rate data for each month from 2012 to 2022. The column “Year” is in the integer type, and the other 12 columns containing unemployment rates are in the double type. Since it is published by the U.S. official organization, we did not find any unreasonable issues or problems. 3.1.2 Unemployment Rate by State Secondly, we will visualize the unemployment rates of each state in the U.S., ranging from October 2019 to September 2022. This data is collected and administered by the Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS) program under the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The state unemployment rate is calculated as the sum of two parts: estimates from the Current Population Survey (CPS)——the source of national unemployment rates——and real-time estimates controlled by models. These models reflect current and historical data from the CPS, the Current Employment Statistics (CES) survey, and state unemployment insurance (UI) systems. We relied on this data because of its reliability and authority. Since each page of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics contains a table for a specific month, we finally got 36 tables. Each table has two columns, states and corresponding unemployment rates, and 52 rows, each of which represents a state or region. The state column contains character data, while the unemployment rate column includes double data. A minor problem we discovered is that it consists of 52 states or regions, not typically 50 states in the U.S., and Puerto Rico sometimes do not have any record while other states all have complete data. 3.1.3 Unemployment Rate by Race Thirdly, we will investigate how unemployment rates differ among different races: Asian, White, and Black, from September 2021 to September 2022. The data is collected and maintained by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, originating from the Current Population Survey (CPS). This survey, administered by the U.S. Census Bureau, investigates the employment situation by sampling 60,000 households. We chose this data source because of its reliability, authority, and easy accessibility. We obtained three tables, each of which records the monthly unemployment rates for White, Asian, and Black, respectively, ranging from January 2012 to November 2022. Each table includes 13 columns and 11 rows. The 13 columns are “Year” and 12 months, respectively, while the 11 rows are unemployment rate data for each month from 2012 to 2022. The column “Year” is in the integer type, and the other 12 columns containing unemployment rates are all in the double type. Since it is published by the U.S. official organization, we did not find any unreasonable issues or problems. 3.1.4 Unemployment Situation by Age and Sex Fourthly, we will investigate the unemployment situation concerning age and sex across different periods. The Division of Labor Force Statistics under the Bureau of Labor Statistics collects and maintains the data. This data was estimated through the household survey given by the Bureau of Labor Statistics based on 60,000 household data sampled by the U.S. Census Bureau. We relied on this data source because of its reliability and authority. We finally had four tables. Two tables are about the unemployed population and unemployment rates, each of which includes 16 columns and 21 rows. The 16 columns include age (character), sex (character), 13 months from September 2021 to September 2022 (integer for unemployed population data and double for unemployment rate data), and the row mean (double). Each row represents a series of unemployment data for a specific-aged and sex group. The other two tables are also about the unemployed population and unemployment rates, which include 10 columns and 21 rows. The 16 columns include age (character), sex (character), unemployed data for September 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022, and unemployed data for 2019 Q3, 2020 Q3, 2021 Q3, and 2022 Q3 (integer for unemployed population data and double for unemployment rate data). Each row contains the unemployment data a specific-aged and sex group. Since it is published by the U.S. official organization, we did not find any unreasonable issues or problems. 3.1.5 Relationships among Unemployed Population, GDP, and CPI Finally, we will explore the relationships among the unemployed population, GDP, and CPI from January 2012 to October 2022. The Bureau of Labor Statistics collects the unemployed population data through the Current Population Survey (CPS), a household survey about the employment situation administered by the U.S. Census Bureau on a sample of 60,000 U.S. households. The GDP data comes from https://ycharts.com, which uses “Macroeconomic Advisors” research results as their data source. Macroeconomic Advisers’ GDP is an indicator of actual aggregate output that is conceptually consistent with real Gross Domestic Product (GDP), using calculation and aggregation methods comparable to the official GDP from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. In this way, we can view the monthly GDP index. The CPI data is maintained by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and calculated by sampling prices of goods from 6,000 households and 22,000 retail stores each month in 75 major regions in the United States. We chose the unemployed population and CPI data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics because of their reliability and authority. However, we chose the GDP data from https://ycharts.com because it contains monthly GDP data rather than quarterly-updated data from other sources, which is easier to access. The unemployed population and CPI tables both have 13 columns and 11 rows. The 13 columns consist of “Year” and 12 months, respectively, while the 11 rows contain unemployment and CPI data for each month from 2012 to 2022. The column “Year” is in the integer type, and the other 12 columns are in the double type. The GDP table consists of 130 records and 2 columns: Date and GDP value. The “Date” column is in the character type, while the GDP value is in the double type. We did not find any unreasonable issues or problems through our exploration. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation In this section, we will discuss how we cleaned and transformed the original datasets into multiple tidy datasets for further visualization regarding these five tasks. The detailed code is included in the Results part. 3.2.1 Monthly Unemployment Rate First, we retrieved data for unemployment rates online and noticed that it needed to be tidy. We used the pivot_longer() function, and it became a data set with each row as the unemployment rate for a month in a year. Next, we created a date variable from the Year and Month abbreviation by the make_date() function so that we could visualize the time series. Also, we found that there was a missing value in our data set, that is, the unemployment rate in December 2022, and we removed it. 3.2.2 Unemployment Rate by State We intend to visualize the unemployment rates of each state in the United States from October 2019 to September 2022. The unemployment rate data for each state of a specific month is included in a table across multiple pages. We downloaded these pages as “.html” files and utilized the rvest package in R to extract the tables from each page. The unemployment rate data of each month corresponds to a table, and finally, we got 36 tables. We divided these data according to time into 3 groups: from October 2019 to September 2020, from October 2020 to September 2021, and from October 2021 to September 2022. We horizontally merged these 36 tables as 3 dataframes, each corresponding to a defined group. We replaced the “-” symbol with NA and transformed each character column into a double column for calculation. In each group, we computed the mean of the unemployment rates within these 12 months for each state. Notice that there are several missing values for unemployment rate data for Puerto Rico, so we decided to remove this state. Then we formed a new dataframe containing four columns: state and corresponding mean values from these three dataframes to visualize the Cleveland dot plot. We also used the pivot_longer() function to transform it into tidy data to visualize the histogram. For spatial data visualization, we merged this dataframe with the geographical data, such as the longitude and latitude of each state. 3.2.3 Unemployment Rate by Race First, we retrieved data for each of the three races online and noticed that it was not tidy. We used the pivot_longer() function, and it became a data set with each row as the unemployment rate for a month in a year. Second, we created a date variable from the Year and Month abbreviation by the make_date() function so that we could visualize the time series. Also, we created a race variable. We did the same above steps for data of all three races and then combined the data sets together horizontally with the rbind() function. 3.2.4 Unemployment Situation by Age and Sex There are four different data frames used to show the unemployment condition among different age intervals. Two of them are averaged unemployment population and unemployment rate data in the third quarters from 2019 to 2022. Two of them are monthly unemployment population and unemployment rate data from September 2021 to September 2022. As the original data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been Excel sheets categorized by age and sex, we only need some trivial transformation to help us plot corresponding charts. For stacked bar charts, we transform our data frames into tidy data with the pivot_longer() method. We changed the year index in the columns into a variable Year so that we can plot four different facets of stacked bar charts based on four different years. We also filtered out the data that represent the sum of unemployment population/rate for both genders as we only need unemployment data for Males and Females for our bar charts. For the heatmap, we used the monthly unemployment rate data from September 2021 to September 2022 and transformed our data frames into tidy data with the pivot_longer() method. We changed the month index in the columns into a variable Month so that we can plot the heatmap by setting months as its x-axis. As Gender is not in our consideration for this graph, we left the unemployment rate data for both genders in total using the filter function. For mosaic plots, we used the monthly unemployment rate data from September 2021 to September 2022 and transformed our data frames into tidy data with the pivot_longer() method. To better show the frequency among different groups, we divided these data into two age intervals (less than 35 years old or more than 35 years old). We also defined three groups of unemployment population “low” (&lt; 7,000,000 people), “medium” (&gt;= 7,000,000 people &amp; &lt; 17,000,000 people), and “high” (&gt; 17,000,000 people) unemployment population. To calculate the frequency of each group, we group the data by Sex, age_category, and category to see how many groups are in each category. 3.2.5 Relationships among Unemployed Population, GDP, and CPI We intend to visualize the unemployed population, GDP, and CPI data from January 2012 to October 2022. The unemployed population, GDP, and CPI data can be exported as “.csv” or “.xlsx” files directly, but they are not in a tidy form. We utilized the pivot_longer() function to transform these three dataframes into tidy data, each of which contains three columns: Year, Month, and Value (i.e., unemployed population or GDP or CPI values). Since we will focus on the data until October 2022, we removed the unemployed population and CPI data corresponding to November 2022 and December 2022, which are unavailable now. Then we merged the three dataframes of tidy data form into a new dataframe based on the year and month for plotting the parallel coordinate plot. We split these data into two groups: “Pre-Covid” and “After-Covid”, and added a new column to show these classes. The “Pre-Covid” refers to the data before 2020 and the “After-Covid” data refers to the data after the beginning of 2020. 3.3 Missing value analysis In this section, we will analyze and visualize how many missing values are in our datasets for the five aspects mentioned above. We found that for all the datasets, there are only very few rows containing missing values in very few columns. In most cases, only a specific row includes missing values. The common philosophy that we dealt with it is to remove this row directly as it will not influence the completeness of the datasets too much. We also discovered that missing values only resulted from two special cases. Firstly, the missing value always appears in the data corresponding to December 2022, which is unavailable without doubt. The appearance of this kind of missing value originates from the untidy form of data. Secondly, for unemployment rates for each state, Puerto Rico sometimes may contain NA data even on the official website. We chose to ignore this special region and focus on other areas. Below is the distribution of missing values in the datasets for the five tasks. 3.3.1 Monthly Unemployment Rate As the above graphs present, there is only one row missing in two columns. After we investigate, we find that the missing data is for December 2022, but the unemployment data is still unavailable now. Hence, the missing data does not make sense, and we can simply remove it for further time series visualization. 3.3.2 Unemployment Rate by State According to the above three groups of graphs, from October 2019 to September 2020, there is one missing row in three different columns. We found that the missing data comes from the same row, which corresponds to Puerto Rico. There is no missing data from October 2020 to September 2021. Moreover, one missing row appears in two columns from October 2021 to September 2022. We also found that this missing data comes from the Puerto Rico row. These facts indicate that only Puerto Rico may contain missing values. For convenience, we removed the row corresponding to this state for further visualization. 3.3.3 Unemployment Rate by Race According to the above graphs, this dataset contains three missing data in the “Unemployment Rate” column. We found that these three missing rows correspond to December 2022 for White, Asian, and Black, respectively. The data for December 2022 is unavailable now, and we should remove them. After that, we can use this dataset to visualize the unemployment rates for different races. 3.3.4 Unemployment Situation by Age and Sex The above four groups of graphs exhibit that there are no missing values within these dataframes, and we can directly use these data for visualization regarding unemployment situation by age and sex. 3.3.5 Relationships among Unemployed Population, GDP, and CPI As the above graphs show, the dataset containing the unemployed population, GDP, CPI, and “Pre/After-Covid” classes do not have any missing values. This dataset is complete and can be directly used for visualizing the relationship between the unemployed population, GDP, and CPI. "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Monthly Unemployment Rate 4.2 Unemployment Rate by State 4.3 Unemployment Rate by Race 4.4 Unemployment Situation by Age and Sex 4.5 Relationships among Unemployed Population, GDP, and CPI", " Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Monthly Unemployment Rate In this section, we will visualize how U.S. unemployment rates changed each month from January 2012 to November 2022. We will visualize this time-series data using a line chart. Moreover, we will explore whether unemployment rates have a cyclical pattern for every month during the past eleven years. 4.1.1 Visualizing Time-series Data: Unemployment Rate From the plot above, we can see that the unemployment rate has been decreasing since 2012, which is very impressive. However, as you can see from the plot, the unemployment rate suddenly soared at the beginning of 2020, and it reached its highest point in April 2020 (14.7). After April 2020, it has been decreasing gradually. Till 2022, it almost went back to the unemployment level before Covid-19. 4.1.2 Exploring Cyclic Pattern of Unemployment Rate As you can see from the plots, each month’s unemployment rate trend is very similar. The unemployment rate has been decreasing since 2012 until the beginning of 2020. The unemployment rate suddenly soared, and it reached its highest point in February 2020. After February 2020, it has been decreasing gradually. And we can notice that the unemployment rate in April and May has changed the most dramatically. 4.2 Unemployment Rate by State In this section, we will visualize the unemployment rates of each state in the U.S. for the last 36 months. We have divided the past 36 months into three periods, listed as Oct 2019 - Sep 2020, Oct 2020 - Sep 2021, and Oct 2021 - Sep 2022. We will explore the distribution of each state’s unemployment rate using a histogram. Also, the average unemployment rate is calculated for each of these three periods for each state, so as to compare each state’s unemployment rate using a Cleveland Dot plot. Moreover, we explore the geographical distribution of unemployment rates using a map. 4.2.1 Unemployment Rate Distribution among Each State These three histogram graphs present the distribution of average unemployment rates of each state in the U.S. from October 2019 to September 2020, from October 2020 to September 2021, and from October 2021 to September 2022. The x-axis represents the average unemployment rate (%), and the y-axis represents how many states have such an unemployment rate. From October 2019 to September 2020, each state’s unemployment rate ranged from 3% to 12.5%, and most states had more than 5% unemployment rates. There was also a state with an average unemployment rate of over 11%. From October 2020 to September 2021, the average unemployment rate of most states ranged from 3.5% to 7.5%. It is obvious that the median of each state’s unemployment rate shifted left, compared to the previous 12 months, which indicates that the unemployed situation was alleviated to some extent. As for the period of October 2021 to September 2022, the median of each state’s unemployment rate shifted left further. Most states had decreased their unemployment rate below 5%, verifying that job markets recovered after the Covid-19 pandemic. 4.2.2 Visualizing Unemployment Rates of Each State by Cleveland Dot Plot This Cleveland dot plot exhibits the unemployment rates of each state in the United States during three different periods of recent 36 months. The purple, green, and yellow dots represent the average monthly unemployment rates from October 2019 to September 2020, from October 2020 to September 2021, and from October 2021 to September 2022. The states on the y-axis are ordered by the average monthly unemployment rates between October 2019 and September 2020. Due to the missing data on Puerto Rico, this graph does not include the unemployment rate data of this state. As this graph shows, in the last 36 months, all the states had the highest unemployment rates between October 2019 and September 2020, and approximately ten states reached more than a 7.5% unemployment rate during this period. These extremely high unemployment rates resulted from the burst of the Covid-19 pandemic, which hugely impacted various industries and caused many people to lose their jobs. During this period, Nevada had the highest unemployment rate of over 12.5% among all the states, while South Dakota had the lowest, which is around 4%. However, this difficult unemployed situation was gradually alleviated in the following 24 months. For most U.S. states, the average unemployment rates for the recent 24-12 months and the recent 12 months gradually decreased from October 2020 to September 2022, except for Connecticut. The average unemployment rate in Connecticut between October 2020 and September 2021 was even higher than that between October 2019 and September 2020. Until September 2022, most states had lowered their average unemployment rate for the recent 12 months below 5%. 4.2.3 Geographical Distribution of Unemployment Rates The above maps show the geographical distribution of average monthly unemployment rates in the U.S. from October 2019 to September 2020, from October 2020 to September 2021, and from October 2021 to September 2022. The shade of color reflects the average unemployment rates during different periods. Deeper blue represents a higher unemployment rate, while lighter blue represents a lower one. We can see the most serious unemployed situations happened from October 2019 to September 2020 from the deeper blue across the U.S. because of the burst of Covid-19. During this period, Nevada had the highest average unemployment rate of over 10% since this state is colored with the deepest blue. In the following 24 months, the unemployment rates in most states gradually dropped as the color on the map gradually becomes lighter. The average unemployment rate from October 2020 to September 2021 in each state was lower than that from October 2019 to October 2020. Also, the average unemployment rate from October 2021 to September 2022 in each state was lower than that from October 2020 to October 2021. These three maps all reveal a pattern that in a specific period, western, southern, and southeastern states suffered more severe unemployed than states in the north and middle, as western, southern, and southeastern states are colored with deeper blue on the map than other states. 4.3 Unemployment Rate by Race In this section, we will explore how unemployment rates differ among White, Asian, and Black Americans from September 2021 to September 2022. We will visualize these data using a grouped bar chart. From the grouped bar chart above, we first notice that the general unemployment rate trend from Sept 2021 to Sept 2022 was slightly decreasing. Among the three races we investigated, Black Americans showed the highest unemployment rate during this period, which was twice as much as the unemployment rate of either White Americans or Asian Americans. In addition, we can notice that before January 2022. the unemployment rate of Asian Americans was higher than White Americans, while White Americans displayed a higher unemployment rate than Asian Americans after January 2022. 4.4 Unemployment Situation by Age and Sex In this section, we will explore how unemployment situations are affected by different ages and sex over various periods. First, we will investigate the unemployed population and unemployment rates in September 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 with stacked bar charts, grouped by sex and age. Second, we will visualize the unemployment rates from September 2021 to September 2022 by various ages using Heatmaps. Then, we categorize the unemployed population into three classes, and we will explore the relationships among sex, age, and unemployed population from September 2021 to September 2022 using mosaic plots. 4.4.1 Visualizing Unemployment by Stacked Bar Charts The above two groups of stacked bar charts show the unemployment population and unemployment rates during the September of each year since 2019. These data are stacked by gender and grouped by age intervals. We can see several trends from these stacked bar charts. First, as we can see from the stacked bar charts of the unemployment population, the number of unemployed people is small between the age of 16 and 24, compared to that of people over 24. But the unemployment rate is much higher among people between 16 and 24 than people over 24. It is reasonable that the labor force of young people (16 to 24) is relatively smaller because many people at this age are still in school. Second, we can see from the unemployment rate charts that the ratio between male unemployment and female unemployment has been close to 1:1 since 2019. It implies that unemployment after Covid-19 does not affect each gender more or less. This phenomenon could be explained by the fact that sex discrimination in the labor market has been paid more attention to by more companies, and employment does not give preference to each gender. Third, we observe that during 2020, the unemployment rate increased dramatically compared to previous years due to Covid-19. Such a situation improved in 2021 when the unemployment rate dropped to a lower level. With the economic recovery, the unemployment rate for employers in most age intervals reached a very low level. However, the unemployment rate for young people aged from 16 to 24 is still high. It is because the economy has just recovered, and many companies need some time to return to the economic level before Covid. Thus, they may not have enough money and efforts to hire and train young employees. 4.4.2 Visualizing Unemployment Rates among Different Ages by Heatmap The heatmap plots the monthly unemployment rate separated by age. Each box within the heatmap corresponds to an age interval and a month between September 2021 and September 2022, which gives a value for the unemployment rate. We can get two primary observations from this heatmap. First, it can be seen vertically that the lower part is more yellowish than the higher part. The more yellowish the color is in the heatmap, the higher the corresponding unemployment rate is. Also, the lower part corresponds to a younger age interval. Based on this information, we can conclude that within each month from September 2021 to September 2022, there exists a higher unemployment rate among younger workers than among more experienced workers. Second, it can be seen horizontally that the colors on the left-hand side are more yellowish on the bottom and more whitish on the top, while the colors on the right-hand side are less yellowish on the bottom and darker on the top. It shows a trend that the unemployment rates among all age intervals have decreased constantly since September 2021. It implies the recovery of the overall labor market after Covid-19. 4.4.3 Visualizing Unemployed Population, Age, and Sex by Mosaic Plot The mosaic plot shows the unemployment condition by depicting the proportion of low, medium, and high unemployment population groups based on both genders and two age intervals (less than 35 years old / more than 35 years old). The data is a monthly unemployment population data from September 2021 to September 2022. The plot shows several trends. First, as the proportion of high unemployment population groups is higher among people over 35 years old, workers less than 35 years old might face a less difficult unemployment situation than those over 35 years old. There can be multiple explanations for this phenomenon. For example, the cardinality of working people over 35 years old could be larger than those under 35 years old. Second, for both age intervals, the proportion of highly unemployed groups is more significant in males than females. It might be explained by various reasons, such as the higher attention paid to gender equality in the workplace. 4.5 Relationships among Unemployed Population, GDP, and CPI As we all know, unemployment has a strong connection with the development of an economy. GDP and CPI are two essential indicators in economics. GDP serves as a vital indicator to capture a country’s economic output, while CPI reflects price changes and the customers’ purchasing ability. In this section, we will attempt to find what factors will influence the unemployed population. We will explore the relationships between the unemployed population, GDP, and CPI. This parallel coordinate plot exhibits the relationship between the unemployed population, GDP, and CPI from January 2012 to October 2022. Each line represents a piece of monthly data on the unemployed population, GDP, and CPI. The data before 2020 is considered as the Pre-Covid period and labeled with yellow, and the data after 2020 (inclusive) is considered as the After-Covid period and labeled with purple. All the unemployed population, GDP, and CPI data are standardized. Both before and after Covid-19, CPI negatively corresponded to the unemployed population. In other words, a higher CPI corresponds to a lower unemployed population and vice versa. However, during the past ten years, the several high CPI and unemployed population data were all from the After-Covid period. We can infer that the Covid-19 pandemic resulted in severe inflation and job loss, significantly impacting people’s lives. Moreover, the unemployed population also negatively corresponded to GDP in both Pre-Covid and After-Covid periods. That is, a higher unemployed population corresponds to a lower GDP. In the past ten years, most GDP values after Covid-19 were still higher than before Covid-19, indicating that generally speaking, GDP in the U.S. had grown gradually in the past ten years. However, due to the enormous impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, several pieces of GDP data were lower than some Pre-Covid GDP values and connected with high unemployed population data.
