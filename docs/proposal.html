<p>As announced in September 2022 by the World Health Organization, the end of the Covid-19 pandemic was in sight. This was great news for the United States and even the whole world. However, this global pandemic has already lasted for three years and made significant impacts on the economy, culture, and society. Most importantly, lots of people’s daily life have been severely influenced. Besides the effects on social life and physical activities, the Covid-19 pandemic has forced many people to lose their jobs. Based on this phenomenon, our group is interested in the unemployment situation in the U.S. after the Covid outbreak, especially the recent year. How did the unemployment situation change after the covid burst out? Can we find any pattern along the time? How did the economic condition influence the unemployment rates in the U.S.? Was the state location a vital factor to consider when it came to the unemployment rate in the U.S.? Do the factors, such as race, age, etc., affect a person’s employment status? Several questions arise in our brains. We intend to get some intuitions into the answers to these questions in this project by conducting a series of exploratory data analysis and visualization.</p>
<p>We collected our data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) website according to our interests. The BLS is the principal fact-finding agency for the Federal government in the broad fields of labor economics and statistics.</p>

<div id="data-availability" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="2.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Data availability<a href="proposal.html#data-availability" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>To investigate the unemployment conditions in the United States, we have decided to utilize the data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. We consider these data sources because they are the U.S. official departments that provide officially valid data. Based on such data, we will draw more convincing conclusions. If we have any questions regarding data, we will attempt to contact the United States Department of Labor and the United States Department of Commerce. Below are five aspects we intend to explore and corresponding data sources for our project.</p>
<div id="unemployment-situation-by-month" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Unemployment Situation by Month<a href="proposal.html#unemployment-situation-by-month" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Firstly, we intend to visualize the seasonally adjusted unemployed population and unemployment rates for each month in the United States from September 2021 to September 2022. The data comes from the Current Population Survey (CPS), a monthly household survey about national employment and unemployment status, by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The historical data is updated monthly and can be retrieved from the <code>[Labor Force Statistics (CPS) database] (https://www.bls.gov/webapps/legacy/cpsatab1.htm)</code>. This database contains employment and unemployment conditions for the total civilian population, men of 16 years old and above, women of 16 years old and above, men of 20 years old and above, women of 20 years old and above, and both sexes with 16-19 years old. Under each category, employment metrics such as employment-population ratio, unemployed population, unemployment rate, etc., are listed. In this task, we will only focus on the unemployed population and unemployment rate for the total civilian population. We will use seasonally adjusted data to eliminate the influence of predictable seasonal patterns and provide a more meaningful metric. By selecting the above conditions and clicking on the “Retrieve Data” button, we will get two tables: unemployed population and unemployment rates for the total civilian population, respectively. Each table records unemployment data, which is continuous numerical data, from January 2012 to September 2022. We will download these two tables from the website as two Excel files and import them into R studio directly. We will use the “dplyr” package in R to filter the corresponding data between September 2021 and September 2022.</p>
</div>
<div id="unemployment-rates-by-state" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.2.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Unemployment Rates by State<a href="proposal.html#unemployment-rates-by-state" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Secondly, we plan to investigate the geographical distribution of unemployment conditions in the United States from September 2021 to September 2022. Specifically, we will visualize each state’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rates, provided by the Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS) program under the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The state unemployment rate is the sum of two parts: estimates from the Current Population Survey (CPS)——the source of national unemployment rates—and real—-time estimates controlled by models. These models reflect current and historical data from the CPS, the Current Employment Statistics (CES) survey, and state unemployment insurance (UI) systems. The unemployment rates are updated on a monthly basis, and the data can be accessed from <code>[Local Area Unemployment Statistics Map] (https://data.bls.gov/lausmap/showMap.jsp;jsessionid=26EFE5EB9A9FF91E84278E09CECCDA06._t3_08v)</code>. Each page presents the state unemployment rate for a specific month. By selecting different years and months, we can access the historical unemployment data at different times. The monthly unemployment data is a two-column table. The first column records the name of each state, which is categorical data, and the second one records the unemployment rate for a specific month, which is continuous numerical data. We plan to utilize the “rvest” package in R to crawl the unemployment information in the table. We will first download the pages for each month and then process them one by one in R.</p>
</div>
<div id="unemployment-situation-by-race" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.2.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.3</span> Unemployment Situation by Race<a href="proposal.html#unemployment-situation-by-race" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Thirdly, we plan to investigate the unemployment status of the civilian population by different races (i.e., white, black or African American, and Asian) from September 2021 to September 2022. Specifically, we will focus on the seasonally adjusted unemployed population and unemployment rates for different races. The data is collected from the Current Population Survey (CPS) by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The data can be retrieved from the <code>[Labor Force Statistics (CPS) database] (https://www.bls.gov/webapps/legacy/cpsatab2.htm)</code>, which contains employment data for White, Black or African American, and Asian. Under each race, the employment status data, such as employed population, unemployed population, unemployment rates, etc., of the total civilian population, men with 20 years old and above, women with 20 years old and above, and both sexes with 16-19 years old is provided. Here we will only select seasonally adjusted unemployed population and unemployment rates for the total civilian population under each race. Finally, we will get six tables, which are “Unemployment Level-White”, “Unemployment Rates-White”, “Unemployment Level-Black or African American”, “Unemployment Rates-Black or African American”, “Unemployment Level-Asian”, and “Unemployment Rates-Asian”. The rows of each table are the years from 2012 to 2022, and the columns are months from January to December. Each table records the continuous numerical data for each metric. Each table can be downloaded directly as an Excel file, and we will import those six files into R studio directly and filter data between September 2021 and September 2022.</p>
